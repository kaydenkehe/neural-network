# Neural Network
This repo contains a neural network built from scratch in NumPy. The project is more of a learning exercise for myself than anything else, and I intend on continuing to add features as I find time / motivation / when I get bored. 

This project was originally based on the notation and content taught by Andrew Ng in his Deep Learning Specialization course, but it will be transitiioned to follow the conventions from in Ovidiu Calin's Deep Learning Architectures book (ISBN 978-3-030-36723-7, https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Architectures-Mathematical-Approach/dp/3030367207/) if I ever get back around to working on it.

## Setup
Install the package: `python -m pip install -e $path to /src$`
